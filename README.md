Web Scraping for Dummies:


Overview:

In recent years, the most popular and widespread systems being used are empowered by machine-learning, analytics and, big data. The common requirement among all these systems is the use of big datasets.
Here, the important question is, if an engineer wants to build a system that requires a considerable amount of data, and does not have access to these datasets, can he/she not develop a decent system? The answer is certainly a yes. I am talking about pulling the data straight out of HTML which mean, that any content that can be viewed on a webpage can be scraped. 


Goals:

Web scraping V/S API call.

Specifications:

Before scraping a website it’s very important to diagnose and analyse the website, before trying to fetch data from it. Let’s have a look at the basic key aspects to consider in order to analyse a website for scraping:
You’ll need to start by finding your “endpoints” — the URL or URLs that return the data you need.
There’s usually some sort of pagination issue which does not allow you to see all of it at once.


Milestones:

Able to build own data set
After the discussion you will be able to scrape data as per your requirement. Build own data set will be much more easier.
